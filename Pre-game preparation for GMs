Note: This is a game for 4-8 players, taking about 4 hours. It requires no player prep ahead of time, and no casting. However, there is some GM prep, described in this document.
1. Read the “How to run the game” document.
2. Gather props: A bowl of water, 8 small stones, a feather, a bell.
3. Game play consumable items: 
- Print out the set of game cards (on card stock if possible) and cut the cards (8 per sheet). You may need to use the "fit to page" option on your printer, and you need to print 2-sided. If you can’t print them out, you could write the text by hand on index cards instead, but there are 80 cards.
- Optionally, you may buy some plastic card holding sleeves (the kind that hold 8 cards in an 8.5x11 inch size)
- Optionally, you may print player "cue sheet" handouts that summarize the workshop and briefings
4. Timer: Have a way to keep time (for different sections of the game) so you can keep things moving along.
5. Have a way to play the pre-recorded audio clips for the Elevation Ceremony (if you want to use the audio clips). Otherwise, a GM can read these parts out loud when needed.
6. Location: This is designed for a single room. 
- Ideally, the room has space where all the players can sit as a group and hear each other talking, but also enough space to circulate and break into subgroups if necessary. This could be couches and chairs arranged around 3 sides of a living room with the middle area clear, or it could be chairs around a conference table with some clear space at the front or back.
- The small flashback scenes can be acted out in the same room, possibly standing or gathering in the clear space.
- The workshop sessions and game play sessions are expected to happen in the same room.
- Players will probably want to rearrange and switch seats for difference scenes
- For Scene 2, in the ritual section, you can have players stand in a semi-circle around a focal altar, which could be a small free standing table or the end of a larger table. The bowl of water, stones, and feather should fit on the surface.
- For Scene 1, when some characters go look into the inner sanctum, you can designate this as one corner of the room, but it may be more dramatic if it is the hallway outside a door, a closet, or otherwise separated from the main space so that those characters are out of sight/earshot of the rest of the group.
7. Scheduling: We have run for 6-8 players in 4 hours. This will vary a lot with the particular group of people, and the size of the game. This game may be more comfortable scheduled in a 4.5 hour slot so there isn’t a lot of pressure to go quickly, particularly if there are 8 players.
