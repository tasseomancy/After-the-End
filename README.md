# After-the-End
What happens after the countdown to the big answer ends with even bigger questions? For the past ten years, you and your Celestial Siblings have worked in anticipation of the Blessed Ascension. Spreading the word of Divine Parent, teaching the new Celestial Cousins as the movement grew…the Sublime Movement was your life. Now that the time for the predicted Blessed Ascension has come and gone, but you didn’t ascend, what’s next?

After the End is a game to explore how an unexpected challenge to the meaning of life impacts individuals, and how people choose and maintain group identities and personal beliefs. Its journey starts with the chaos of the immediate aftermath, flashes back to the moment of commitment and a previous crisis of faith, then returns to the group’s decision about the movement’s future. Gameplay can include both humor and heartbreak, depending on how players steer the narrative.

This is a four-hour game for 4-8 players. There are four major scenes with pre-scene workshops for each scene. No pre-game preparation is required, and there is no pre-casting of characters. After the End premiered at the Twin Cities Make a Scene Festival in August 2023.
